# Loss Development Triangle Generator

(This app is only used for MASA Hackathon 2020 purposes and not intended for public use)

:question: A loss development triangle is a unique way of arranging the annual loss evaluations for several past policy periods. By arranging the loss evaluations for past years in a table, we can analyze the change in losses from one evaluation to the next. In this app, we are using the Mack's chain-ladder method, one of the popular ways that insurance companies use to estimate their required claim reserves. A claims reserve is money set aside for a claim that has been reported but not settled (RBNS) or incurred but not reported (IBNR).
